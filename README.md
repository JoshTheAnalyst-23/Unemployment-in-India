# Unemployment in India - Data Analysis Using R

This project explores unemployment trends across Indian states using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. It answers key analytical questions related to unemployment patterns, regional disparities, and correlations with labor metrics.

## 📊 Objectives

This analysis addresses the following questions:

1. How has the unemployment rate changed over time (by date)?
2. Are there any seasonal patterns in unemployment?
3. Which years or months had the highest and lowest unemployment rates?
4. Which Indian states have the highest and lowest unemployment rates?
5. Are there regional disparities in employment and unemployment?
6. Is there a correlation between the labor participation rate and unemployment?
7. What is the estimated employed percentage in each state?
8. Are there any states where the employed percentage differs significantly from the national average?
9. How does the employed percentage correlate with the unemployment rate?
10. What is the estimated labor participation rate in each state?
11. Is there a relationship between labor participation and unemployment?
