# Unemployment in India – Data Analysis Using R



![Unemployment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bd2a2dd-95fa-414a-8a87-16e8dae9b8a8)


This project explores unemployment trends across India using a Kaggle dataset. Using R with libraries like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `readxl`, we investigate time-based patterns, regional disparities, and correlations among employment metrics.

## 📌 Project Objectives

This analysis answers the following:

- How has the unemployment rate changed over time?
- Are there seasonal patterns in unemployment?
- Which years/months had the highest and lowest unemployment rates?
- Which Indian states have the highest and lowest unemployment rates?
- Are there regional disparities in employment/unemployment?
- Is there a correlation between labor participation rate and unemployment?
- What is the estimated employed percentage in each state?
- Do any states significantly differ from the national employment average?
- What is the relationship between employment and unemployment rates?
- What is the labor participation rate per state?
- Any relationship between labor participation and unemployment?
